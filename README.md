el32-buildroot
==============
Buildroot fork for Embedded Linux course.

This repository contains support for building an Embedded Linux distribution (kernel, rootfilesystem) and a crosscompilation toolchain.

Setup
-----
Install required tools:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libncurses5-dev whois git subversion parted kpartx dosfstools extlinux qemu qemu-system putty
```

Clone this repository:
```
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/fhict/el32-buildroot.git buildroot
```

Raspberry Pi
------------
Build an Embedded Linux distribution and crosscompilation toolchain for the Raspberri Pi.

For the *Raspberry Pi B or B+* do as follows:
```
$ cd buildroot
$ make raspberrypi_defconfig
$ make
```

In case you have a *Raspberry PI 2 B* you need to use a different defconfig:
```
$ cd buildroot
$ make raspberrypi2_defconfig
$ make
```

If you have a *Raspberry PI 3 B* use the following defconfig:
```
$ cd buildroot
$ make raspberrypi3_defconfig
$ make
```

Now you will have to wait quite a while for the build to complete. If everything went well a kernel (`zImage`), a root filesystem (`rootfs`), and a bootable disk image (`sdcard.img`) will be available in the directory `output/images/`.

The toolchain generated by Buildroot is located by default in `output/host/`. The simplest way to use it is to add `output/host/usr/bin/` to your PATH environment variable (`export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/buildroot/output/host/usr/bin`).  To make this permament enter it in your .bashrc file (`echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/buildroot/output/host/usr/bin' >> ~/.bashrc`). You can then use the crosscompilers simply as `arm-linux-gcc` (C compiler) and `arm-linux-g++` (C++ compiler) without a path prefix.

The disk image should be written on a SD card and inserted in the Raspberry Pi. Writing the image on the SD card can be done as follows:
```
$ sudo umount /dev/mmcblk0*
$ sudo dd if=output/images/sdcard.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=4M
$ sudo sync
```
Above command assumes the SD card reader is connected as /dev/mmcblk0. Check the output of the command `dmesg | tail` directly after inserting a SD card to see if this is the case. If not change the device name to comply with your configuration.

After booting the Raspberry Pi you should be able to login as `root` with password `root`.

Soekris NET4801
---------------
Build an Embedded Linux distribution and crosscompilation toolchain for the Soekris NET4801 board:
```
$ cd buildroot
$ make soekris_net4801_defconfig
$ make
```
Now you will have to wait quite a while for it to complete. If everything went well a kernel (`bzImage`), a root filesystem (`rootfs`), and a bootable disk image (`soekris.img`) will be available in the directory `output/images/`.

The toolchain generated by Buildroot is located by default in `output/host/`. The simplest way to use it is to add `output/host/usr/bin/` to your PATH environment variable (`export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/buildroot/output/host/usr/bin`).  To make this permament enter it in your .bashrc file (`echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/buildroot/output/host/usr/bin' >> ~/.bashrc`). You can then use the crosscompilers simply as `i586-linux-gcc` (C compiler) and `i586-linux-g++` (C++ compiler) without a path prefix.

The disk image should be written on a CompactFlash (CF) card and inserted in the Soekris board. Writing the image on the CF card can be done as follows:
```
$ sudo umount /dev/sdc*
$ sudo dd if=output/images/soekris.img of=/dev/sdc bs=1M
$ sudo sync
```
Above command assumes the CF card reader is connected as /dev/sdc. Check the output of the command `dmesg | tail` directly after inserting a CF card to see if this is the case. If not change the device name to comply with your configuration.

To test the kernel and rootfs with QEMU:
```
$ qemu-system-i386 -kernel output/images/bzImage -append "root=/dev/sda panic=1 console=ttyS0" -no-reboot -serial stdio -hda output/images/rootfs.ext2
```
This command will boot a virtualized Soekris. In fact it is running the Soekris root filesystem on a virtualized PC.

After booting the real or the virtual Soekris you should be able to login as `root` with password `root`.
